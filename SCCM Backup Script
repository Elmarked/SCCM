.SYNOPSIS
    This script checks a ConfigMgr site backup to ensure success and performs various post-backup functions that 
    back up other critical data that the built-in ConfigMgr site backup task does not.
.DESCRIPTION
    This script checks any previous backup attempt ran within the last hour of this script running for a
    a successful run if backup check is selected.  It assumes you also have SSRS installed on the site DB server 
    and backs up both SSRS databases, exports out the SSRS encryption keys, backs up the export file and the 
    entire ReportingServices folder on the server.  Once SSRS has been backed up, it then also copies the entire 
    SCCMContentLib folder, client install folder and the afterbackup.bat file to the destination backup folder path.  
    Once complete, it then attaches the log file it creates as part of the process and emails it out to the defined recipient.

    The script intends on creating 7 days worth of backups in a central location labeled Monday through Friday
    and places a copy of all backed up components in each day's folder.

.EXAMPLE
    .\Start-PostConfigMgrBackupSteps.ps1
    This example uses all default parameters for the script which will be the most likely way it is executed.
.PARAMETER SiteCode
    The ConfigMgr site code that the site server is a part of
.PARAMETER SiteDbServer
    The Configmgr site server that has the Reporting Services Point and the Site database server role installed.
.PARAMETER DestDbBackupFolderPath
    The UNC root folder path where the days' backup folders will be copied to
.PARAMETER SrcReportingServicesFolderPath
    The UNC folder path where you have installed reporting services to on the server.
.PARAMETER ReportingServicesDbBackupSqlFilePath
    The UNC file path to the SQL file that is dynamically created (if not exists) that the script passes to the 
    sqlcmd utility to kick off a backup of the SSRS databases.  This does not have to exist.  It is recommended
    to allow the script to create this.
.PARAMETER ReportingServicesEncKeyPassword
    The password that's set on the exported SSRS keys
.PARAMETER SrcContentLibraryFolderPath
    The folder path to ConfigMgr's content library on the site server.  This folder is called SCCMContentLib. The
    default path probably does not need to be changed.
.PARAMETER SrcClientInstallerFolderPath
    The folder path where the ConfigMgr client install is located on the site server.  This is backed up if you
    have any hotfixes being installed with your clients and may be located in here.
.PARAMETER SrcAfterBackupFilePath
    The file path where the afterbackup.bat file is located.  You should not have to change this from the default.
.PARAMETER LogFilesFolderPath
    The folder path where the script will create a log file for each day it runs.
.PARAMETER CheckBackup
    Use this switch to first check to ensure a recent backup was successful.  This parameter is recommended
    when running inside the afterbackup.bat file.
